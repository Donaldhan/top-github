I'll be pleased to add a vector if you can find one that suits the app (in SVG or XML Vector format).\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n#### Data storage\r\nSaving personal settings (like the languages) on a DB was a little overkill so I opted for saving them in SharedPreferences (with the help of [EasyDatastore](https://github.com/fdoyle/EasyDatastore])).\r\n<br/>\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\nThis app is totally free, you can do whatever you want to it.  \r\nPlease, let me know if you find any bug!\r\nI also plan to:\r\n* Use a MVVM pattern with [the new Android Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/tools/data-binding/guide.html) to bind the views to the Recyclerviews\r\n* Add more options and vectors to the app\r\n<br/>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
